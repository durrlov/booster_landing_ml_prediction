## 1. Introduction <a name= "introduction"></a>
This project showcases an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** designed to predict whether the **first stage (booster) of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket** will successfully land.  

This integrates 
- Data collection from SpaceX API
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training with multiple ML algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
- Flask app for interactive user prediction
- Deployment on Render

## 2. Problem Statement<a name= "problem"></a>
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage (booster).

Therefore we aim to determine whether the first stage will land successfully or not. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## 8. Conclusion & Insights<a name= "conclusion"></a>
- Launch to VLEO, LEO and ISS orbits have a very high success rate to other orbits, suggesting others are more challenging for re-landing the first stage.
- KSC LC 39A and VAFB SLC 4E launch sites have a much higher success rate compared to CCSFS SLC 40, indicating the launch location is a key factor in landing success.
- High number of successful landings occurred when components like GridFins, and Legs were used, confirming their importance in the recovery process.
- Without landing pad, the success rate is very low.
- The more the payload mass, the more likely the first stage will land successfully.
- Temporal trends shows a significant upward trend in the landing success rate over the years.

  Encapsulates model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Supports multiple regression algorithms and exports the best-performing model.

- train_pipeline.py  
  Runs the full model training workflow by calling data ingestion, transformation, and model trainer modules.
